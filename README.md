# Microservice to scrape StackOverflow answers for Python code
This is a Microservice created using Amazon Cloud Services. It was built using Cloud9 and FastAPI, and was deployed using AWS AppRunner. It inputs a query related to python, scrapes Stackoverflow for answers (using howdoi) and returns the code for that query as a json payload. Continuous Integration and Continous Delivery has been set up with Github Actions.
